A capstone project aimed at building a machine learning-based model to automatically detect and classify faults in a power distribution system using electrical measurement data.

## Problem Statement

Rapid and accurate fault identification in electrical grids is essential for ensuring system reliability and reducing downtime. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can classify different types of faults â€” such as line-to-ground, line-to-line, and three-phase faults â€” using electrical parameters like voltage and current phasors.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a supervised machine learning solution that:

* Processes historical fault data
* Classifies fault types using voltage, current, environmental, and component health indicators
* Is deployed on IBM Cloud for real-time predictions

### Key Components

* **Data Collection**: Fault dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/power-system-faults-dataset)
* **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and noise
* **Model Selection**: Algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression were evaluated
* **Deployment**: IBM Watsonx.ai Studio with IBM Cloud Object Storage
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, MAE, RMSE

## Algorithm & Deployment

* **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Classifier (selected for high performance)
* **Input Features**:

  * Voltage & Current
  * Power Load
  * Temperature & Wind Speed
  * Weather Conditions
  * Maintenance Status
  * Component Health
  * Duration of Fault
* **Training**: Supervised Learning using labeled fault types
* **Deployment Platform**: IBM Watsonx.ai Studio with real-time data access via IBM Cloud Object Storage and API endpoints
